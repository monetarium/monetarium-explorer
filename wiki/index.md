### Charts

_Historical data fetching, cache aggregation, and payload serialization for UI charts. Covers the legacy VAR `coin-supply` pipeline alongside the per-coin SKA `coin-supply/{N}` pipeline (lazy load, `*big.Int` cumulation, exact-precision legend)._

- impact: code-analysis/visualblocks/impact.md — mutation impact across HTTP/WS/JS/DB layers, loud and silent failure modes, safe-change checklist

### Attack-Cost

_The `/attack-cost` majority-attack calculator: a no-compute Go handler reads a shared VAR-only `HomeInfo` snapshot into `data-*` attributes; all PoW/PoS math runs client-side in `attackcost_controller.js`. VAR-only by construction (legacy flat `CoinSupply`/`DCR` labels); not portable to SKA without a BigInt rewrite._

### Parameters

_The `/parameters` page: active-network consensus config. ~95% static `chaincfg.Params` captured once at startup; only `MaximumBlockSize` is dynamic (tip-only RPC `GetBlockChainInfo`). Dual param injection (`commonData.ChainParams` + handler `ExtendedParams`), block-scoped ETag cache, VAR-only subsidy rows._

- flow (compact): code-analysis/parameters/flow.compact.md — high-level summary of the static-vs-dynamic split, dual injection, and silent/hard failure modes

- impact: code-analysis/parameters/impact.md — commonData nil → .ChainParams deref crash, silent blank/misaligned address-prefix table on unknown network, stale/empty-slice MaximumBlockSize, unlocked pageData.BlockchainInfo race

### Page-Rendering (cross-domain consolidation)

_Mode-4 consolidation of the shared mechanics behind every server-rendered HTML page (block, mempool, visualblocks, parameters, charts, address). Not a flow — read alongside the per-domain flows it links. Covers out-of-band shared `pageData`/`invs` state, the multi-lock discipline, `*CommonPageData` struct-embedding template injection, and block-scoped ETag caching._

- patterns: code-analysis/page-rendering/patterns.md — out-of-band shared page state via saver fan-out, `pageData`/`invsMtx` lock discipline, `*CommonPageData` embedding, block-scoped ETag cache
